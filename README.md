 <h4>First step :</h4>
The skeleton structure of the desired SPA was created with bootstrap.
<h4>Second step : </h4>
The API provided for the data to be displayed was analyzed in Postman and the URL was designed to provide the data I wanted, and the user was asked to enter the necessary parameters. It is assigned to constant variables with useState so that these values ​​can be used in the URL.
<h4>Third step : </h4>
In order to be able to pull the data we want to display with the API and use it on any page I want, the data is pulled using the Custom Hook. It was then fragmented and the raw information I wanted was obtained.
Fourth step<h4> </h4>
The components of the pages I will create are designed and placed according to the place I want them to be on the pages.
<h4>Fifth step :</h4>   
Other pages to be accessed were designed and data exchange was provided between the pages with props, location and navigate methods.
<h4>Final :</h4> 
I finished my work by completing the styling process of the page using Scss, Css, GoogleFont, MUI@Icons and Boostrap according to my own taste.
